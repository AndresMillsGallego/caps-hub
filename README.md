# CAPS - Event Driven Applications

**Lab 11**

For this lab we moved away from authentication and authorization, and are focusing on Event Driven Apps using Node.js. 

**Lab 12**

Dor this lab we expanded on what we started with lab 11 and introduced `sockets`!  We implemented a server using a `PORT`, and created different sockets that all connected to the `/caps` namespace.
The end result, or output of the code was essentially the same, but with a full refactor and a different implementation.
